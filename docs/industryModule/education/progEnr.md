**Program Enrollment is the record of enrollment of a student in a given program and chosen courses for a particular Academic Term.**

To ensure that students are associated with a particular program in the system, their Program Enrollment must be created. The mandatory course in that program is automatically filled in the Enrolled Courses table while the elective or optional courses can be selected manually.

If the student has applied online for the admission in a particular Program and the application is approved, then the Program Enrollment can be created from within the Student Applicant record via clicking on the Enroll button. Checkout Student Applicant for more information on this.
