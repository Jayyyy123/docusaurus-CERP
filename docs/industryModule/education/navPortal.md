### Home Page

**The portal is hosted on the /lms route.** (Example. hogwarts.erpnext.com/lms) Here all the programs are shown in the form of cards. Each card is clickable and navigates to the corresponding program/course/topic/content. The portal is accessible even if a student has not logged in, however, the content (Articles, Videos, etc) can only be accessible after login and enrolling in the program.

### Program Page

On the program page, the student can see the description as well as the list of courses in the form of cards. If the student is not enrolled, a button to enroll will be shown. This will happen only if self enroll is enabled in the program doc, if not then the program won't be visible to the student at all.

After enrolling, the status of each course is added to the card footer. This status is updated based on the student's activity on the portal.
