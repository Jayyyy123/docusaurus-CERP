Whether you are running a B-School, an Academy or even a Primary School, the CERP Education Module helps you in organizing your entire set-up. You can have your entire Student Database, Fee Structure, Staffing Information, Courses, Curriculum, all defined in CERP.

We also understand that an Educational Institute needs a lot more than a simple 'Education Module', and CERP has all of it available built-in. You can:

- Track your books of accounts using Accounts module.
- Manage payroll, leaves, and claims of your admin and teaching staff in the HR module.
- Organize your purchases and place an approval system.
  Here are the functionalities available under the CERP Education domain to go through after this introduction
