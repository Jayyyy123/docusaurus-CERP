**To ease out the data entry while recording the Patient Encounter, CERP Healthcare allows you to save every Complaint / Diagnosis data you enter as a Master, from the Patient Encounter screen itself. This way, the database keeps building a list of all complaints and diagnoses you entered. This is done for better analytics and reporting.**

You can also configure the masters manually by going to,
:::note
Home > Healthcare > Consultation > Complaint
