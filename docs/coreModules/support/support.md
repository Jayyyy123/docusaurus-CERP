Great customer support and maintenance is at the heart of any successful business. With CERP, you track all incoming customer requests and issues and respond to them quickly. The database of incoming queries will also help you to identify the biggest opportunities for improvements.

You can track incoming queries from your email using Support Tickets. You can keep track of Customer Issues linked with a specific Serial No and respond to them based on their warranty and other information. You can also make Maintenance Schedules for Serial NOs and keep a record of all Maintenance Visits made to your Customers.
