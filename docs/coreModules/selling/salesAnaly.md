## 1. Sales Analytics Report

Go to Selling > Analytics > Sales Analytics. The Sales Analytics report looks like this:

~~Sales Analytics Sections~~

The toolbar provides filters to select what data is to be used. Using the dropdown selections, the data displayed can be refined. As the selections are made, data is reflected in the data window as well as the graph window.

~~Sales Analytics Filters~~

Within the data window, selections can be made to expand or compress the data to be analyzed. At the left-hand side highlighted in blue are selection boxes. Each box can be selected or unselected. There is no restriction for data comparison, so a higher level can be compared to a lower level.

In the following screenshot, the data column to the right highlighted in orange contains selection boxes with + and minus selections. Selecting a + will expand the data and selecting a â€“ will compress the data. As this is performed, the Graph Window is dynamically altered allowing rapid data analysis.

Once a date range has been selected, the graph is updated, the graph reflects the changes and the associated labels.

## 3. Customer Acquisition and Loyalty Report

Go to Selling > Analytics. To understand revenue, it's often helpful to look at the data from a new customer and existing customers standpoint. This report helps visualize customer loyalty. There are two windows within this report: The Filter Window and the Data Window.

~~WIP report~~

Accessing the Filter Window, the company and date ranges can be applied. Data is updated in the Data Window as changes are applied.

Within the Data Window, columns of information are accessible.

- Sorting: To sort the data in columns, click on the right-hand side of a column heading and you'll see options to sort as ascending, descending, reset sorting, or remove a column.
- Filtering: The text boxes below the column headings work as instant filters. Enter a number there and all matching records will be shown.
