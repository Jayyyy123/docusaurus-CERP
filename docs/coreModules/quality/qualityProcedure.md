## 1. How to create a Quality Procedure

1. Go to the Quality Procedure list, click on New.
1. Enter a name for the Quality Procedure.
1. In the Processes table, enter Process Descriptions.
    - Child Procedure: If the Quality Procedure being created a is a parent procedure that contains sub-procedures, link the sub-procedure here. On doing this, the current procedure becomes a parent and the 'Is Group' checkbox is enabled.
1. Save. A Quality Procedure can also be saved without entering the Process descriptions if the title is self explanatory.

The 'Parent Procedure' is linked to the child procedure. For example 'Demo preparation' needs to be done before a demo and hence 'Product Demo' is the parent here:
