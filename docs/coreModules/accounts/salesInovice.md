Accounting Impact
All Sales must be booked against an “Income Account”. This refers to an Account in the “Income” section of your Chart of Accounts. It is a good practice to classify your income by type (like product income, service income, etc). The Income Account must be set for each row of the Items table.

:::tip
Tip: To set default Income Accounts for Items, you can set it in the Item or Item Group.
:::

The other account that is affected is the Account of the Customer. That is automatically set from “Debit To” in the heading section.

You can also mention the Cost Centers in which your Income must be booked. Remember that your Cost Centers tell you the profitability of the different lines of business or product. You can also set a default Cost Center in the Item master. See also: Accounting Dimensions.

Accounting entries (GL Entry) for a typical double entry “Sale”:
When booking a sale (accrual):

- Debit: Customer (grand total)
- Credit: Income (net total, minus taxes for each Item)
