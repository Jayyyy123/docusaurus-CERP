**Payment Terms Template allow you to club multiple payment terms together and fetch in transactions.**

After creation, the Payment Terms Table can be set to a specific Customer/Supplier. On selecting the Customer/Supplier in a transaction, the Payment Terms Template will be fetched automatically into the transaction.

For example:

If you receive payment in the slab of 30-70, then you can define Payment Term for each slab, i.e. 30% and 70%.

In the Payment Terms Template, you can select all the Payment Terms and define a template which can be easily applied in the sales and purchase transactions.
