**The amount of entitled leaves in a Company for an Employee in a Leave Period is known as Leave Policy.**

It is a practice for many enterprises to enforce a general Leave Policy to effectively track and manage Employee leaves. CERP allows you to create and manage multiple Leave Policies and allocate leaves to Employees as defined by the policy.

To access Leave Policy, go to:
:::note
Home > Human Resources > Leaves > Leave Policy
:::

## 1. How to create a Leave Policy

1. Go to Leave Policy list, click on New.
1. Select the Leave Type and enter its Annual Allocation.
1. Save and Submit.

~~Leave Policy~~

Once submitted, you can enforce the Leave Policy through the dashboard, either to an Employee or an Employee Grade.

When a Leave Policy is assigned to an Employee Grade, it will ensure that all leave allocations for employees of this grade will be as per the Leave Policy. In case you need to selectively update the Leave Policy for a particular Employee, you can do so by tagging the Leave Policy in the Employee master under the 'Attendance and Leave Details' section.
