Employee Separation is a situation when the service agreement of an Employee with his/her organization comes to an end and the Employee leaves the organization.

Employee Separation is created for an Employee who has resigned or terminated from the organization.

Use Case: Let's assume that following are the activities which need to be performed as soon as an Employee needs to be separated from the organization.

1. Collect laptop
1. Clear dues
1. Delete Employee Email Account
1. Collect identity card

In CERP, these standard activities can be tracked in the Employee Separation Template. To access Employee Separation, go to:

Human Resources > Employee Lifecycle > Employee Separation

## 1. Prerequisites

Before creating an Employee Separation, it is advisable that you create the following documents:

- Employee
- Department
