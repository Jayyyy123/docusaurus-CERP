- The actual amount allotted by the employer as the HRA.
- Actual rent paid less 10% of the basic salary.
- 50% of the basic salary, if the employee is staying in a metro city (40% for a non-metro city).
- As part of the Employee Tax Exemption Declaration, employees can also fill out the HRA Exemption. CERP calculates the exemption eligible for HRA and exempts it while calculating the taxable earnings.

Enter the Monthly House Rent and check the 'Rented in Metro City' checkbox if applicable and submit the form. The Annual and Monthly HRA Exemption will be automatically calculated.

Once the declaration is submitted, you can submit the proof of your tax exemption by clicking on the Submit Proof button.
