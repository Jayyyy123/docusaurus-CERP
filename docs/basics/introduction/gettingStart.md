There are many ways to get started with CERP.

## 1. See the Demo

If you want to check out the user interface and feel the application, just see the demo at:

[https://demo.erpnext.com](https://demo.erpnext.com)

## 2. Start a Free Account at CERP.com

CERP.com is managed by the organization (Frappe) that publishes CERP. You can start with your own account by [signing up on the website](https://erpnext.com/).

You can also decide to host your application at erpnext.com by buying the hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and improves CERP. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the hosting plans.

## 3. Download a Virtual Machine

To avoid the trouble of installing an instance, CERP is available as a Virtual Image (a full loaded operating system with CERP installed). You can use this on any platform including Microsoft Windows.

[Click here to see instructions on how to use the Virtual Image](https://erpnext.org/get-started)

## 4. Install CERP on your Unix/Linux/Mac machine

If you are familiar with installing applications on \*nix platforms, read the instructions on how to install using [Frappe Bench.](https://github.com/frappe/bench)
