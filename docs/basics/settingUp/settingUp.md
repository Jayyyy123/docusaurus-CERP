Setting up an CERP system is like starting your business all over again but in the virtual world. Thankfully it is not as hard as the real business and you get to do a trial too!

To get an CERP implementation right, the implementor needs to set aside time and perform the implementation with dedication. Usually, this is not your post work side project you spare a couple of hours on.
