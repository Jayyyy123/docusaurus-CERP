When you do this, you will ve asked to enter the periodicity of this event in the 'Repeat On'. This could be daily, monthly, weekly or Yearly.

You can also enter the last day of the repeated occurrence in the 'Repeat Till' field. In case of infinite repetitions, you may choose to leave this field blank.
