Websites are a core component of any business. Having a good website usually means running into obstacles like investing a lot of money, difficult to update, and it not being interactive.

If you're not a web designer yourself, wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to update the product catalog on your site automatically from your ERP? We thought exactly the same thing and hence built a small Website module right inside CERP! Using this module, you can:

- Create Web Pages
- Write Blogs
- Publish your Product Catalog using the Item master
- Allow users to buy your products using the Shopping Cart

Though not necessary, to make a good website, you might have to know a bit of HTML/CSS or hire the services of a professional. The good part is that once this is set up, you can add and edit content, blogs, and products directly from your CERP account.

You can check out this video for a demonstration of the Website module in CERP.
